This is an AI-Chatbot just like <b>Chat GPT</b>. We are using Django and Open-AI API to build this. It is going to be a chatbot where you can ask it questions and it's going to give responses to that question. We have also implemented user authentication.So, we're going to allow a user to register and login to our platform. And whenever a user logs out and logs back in and they're going to see the history of messages that they've sent before
